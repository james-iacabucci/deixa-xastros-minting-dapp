COLLECTION ART 
- layer/trait names and rarity
- NFT description, name and other metadata
- collection metadata

MINTING DAPP

- add promoter tracking (owned, paid, enable/disable)
-- register code or store whatever is passed
-- promoter register so we record their wallet, us so its stored in the contract, or record anything
-- if promoter code not found, reject purchase, ignore, record unregistered code anyway

- logging of errors to Moralis db
- add dollar purchase price
- test/tune for mobile
- test different wallets
- Add nice welcome message with link to instructions (metamask setup, buy ETH, walletconnect, crossmint) 
- Add T&C before purchase (checkbox ahead of time to enable buy button)
- add links to copyright and help (email or discord or ?)
- turn on transaction sync on Moralis and ensure we're capturing all tx (even those that fail)

- add auto refresh when events are emitted 
- add drop down on wallet address (balance, disconnect, etherscan, etc)
- restructure so same base project can be used for all projects (move to env? have "projects" shared config with env setting?)
- if in test, allow setting of sale date (so countdown can read it) 

CONTRACT

- expose more 721A functions

- return addresses of all current owners with balances (enumerable?)
- return list of all free / gold list claimers (enumberable?)
- ensure metadata is compatible on Rarible and others
- retest deployer address vs owner address in how collection appears in Opensea
- finish test automation
- test with Ledger wallet to deploy / sign

- add reward claimed feature to reward contract (login, read wallet for NFTs owned, ask reward contract if claimed, claim)
- maybe upgrade to 721A (v4)
- allow payment address (or addresses) to be changed
- add multiple owners (add, remove) and change onlyOwner
- add royalty info (opensea, rarable)
- add countdown auto-unlock
- limit max owned
- get frozen metadata working
- add events/emit 
- investigate staking (duration of ownership, locked vs transferred)
- earn by owning / commitment to not sell (locked for x days)
- use charm bracelet for free and gold list?

HOSTING
- test AWS Hosting (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html)
- GITHUB (is Cloudflare needed? https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/)

RELEASE
- setup production Morais and Infura accounts
- setup production admin wallet
- read Hashlips discord for issues (and search Google)
- update env to prod accounts 
- set contract metadata
- set art metadata defaults and prereveal
update CollectionConfig (opensea url, etc..)
- should we spend the $ to do a test on MainNet (with different images/contract names)?

TESTING 
- allow each sale type to have limits
- handle reverted/rejected transactions  
- make function to set all sale params at once
- test changing IPFS location (basedURI, hiddenMetadataURI)
- not enough funds disables purchase
- sold out disables purchase and shows message
- not on mainnet disables purchase and shows message
- no wallet, nice message and link to setup wallet
- show balance when wallet connected, hide when not

- hide collection info and show message if contract not found or web3 not accessible (moralis error)
- Gold List ability to mint token only if on list

- allow change of uri in case something goes wrong (or pinata fails)

NEXT STEPS
look at cool cats
- change to mainnet in header (see cool cats)
- browse collection
- browse your nfts
show steps for staking (approve then stake)
